          Iterator{?}
          greater-than(>? a, b)
          less-than(>? a, b)


NOTES ABOUT <-: this operator is used to refer specifically to the address
                of the variable instead of the value.
                This has three applications:
                  1) to specify that you want to pass a fundamental-typed 
                     variable by reference instead of by value.
                     If there are two functions available, one of which
                     accepts a fundamental instance and the other of
                     which accepts a fundamental pointer, the version
                     which accepts an instance will be preferred over the 
                     version which accepts a pointer, unless you use <- to 
                     specify that you want to pass the address instead of 
                     the value.
                  2) to be a condition.  When used as a condition, a
                     variable's value is generally what's used.  If you
                     use a variable's address as a condition, NOWHERE will
                     be interpreted as false, and anything else will be 
                     interpreted as true.
                  3) to perform operations on an address.  For example:
                     (a<- + 5 as Size) will be an address 5 bytes after the
                     address of a.  This also works with -, +=, and -=, and
                     it is useful when used in conjunction with offset-of.




MODULES:

TODO




GROUPS:

A group consists of either a reference to another module or a map of names.
If a module is imported to a group, then anything that was or is put into 
that group becomes an addon to that module instead.

Only one module is allowed per group.




ADDONS:

Each synonym has a block ID number indicating which block it's
from, and each block has a map of IDs of imported blocks which 
can be queried to test whether the synonym in question is imported.

When you add a synonym to a group to which a module has been imported,
that synonym becomes an "addon" to that imported module, and is only visible
in a block to which both the module that creates the addon and the module
that has been added onto have been imported.

TEMPLATES VS INSTANCES:

When writing tang code, one is actually writing /templates/ for
types and functions.  Instances of types and functions are /generated/
from these templates.



INDETERMINATES AND DETERMINATES:

A type or function template may have a list of indeterminates (an
"indeterminate-list," similar to a function's parameter list).  When a
function or type template is invoked, each indeterminate is filled by
a "determinate".  For each unique combination of determinates
with which the template is invoked, an instance is generated.

A determinate must be something that can be known at compile time: a type,
a function, a group, a literal, a constant, or an endian-indicator.
In other words, either a literal, endian-indicator or an 
asynchronous name.  See below.



PARTS:

Each word, punctuation mark, string literal, or character literal is a "part."
A "part" is literally some text in the code.  It is important
for us to distinguish between the parts themselves and the
meanings that the parts convey.



EXPRESSIONS:

Parts get interpreted into expressions.  There are many types of expressions;
depending on the type, an expression may consist of a name with 
indeterminate-list, or a literal value, or it may have any number of inputs 
which are themselves expressions.  An expression yields one output, 
which is of one entity type (note that the entity type will vary 
depending on the function instance, so it can't be determined until
the synchronous pass).


TODO: types of expression



TYPES:

There are three kinds of types: type template, 
                                type instance, 
                                entity type.

A type template is what the source code directly describes.  The template
may have a list of indeterminates.  For each unique combination of determinates
with which the type template is invoked, a type instance will be generated.

An entity type may be a type instance, or it may be an array type of known
or unkown length, in which case it will contain a pointer to another
entity type, that of the objects in the array (which itself may be 
another array type, though this one must be of known length).

An entity type also has flags indicating:
 - whether or not the address is accessible
 - whether or not the value is accessible
 - whether or not the address is mutable
 - whether or not the value is mutable
 - whether or not the entity is indexable[]
 - whether the entity can be passed or returned by value
 - whether this entity is a c value or a c pointer under the hood
 - whether this entity is specified little endian
 - whether this entity is specified big endian
 - whether or not the address is emphasized.

Note that the <- operator technically just sets the "address is emphasized"
flag to "true."




TODO: how to access array length?  Perhaps that's its own expression?



ENTITIES:

An entity is what's outputted by an expression.  It's important to note
that an entity isn't something that persistently exists in the compiler's
model of the code, it's something ephemeral that can flit in and out of
existence during an expression.

An entity can be a c value or it can be a c pointer under the hood.


TODO: unnamed instances of classes or forms?



SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS:

TODO


TODO: Entry-Point




ERRORS:

During the course of a function, you may use:

set-error value

Where value is an expression of the type Int32.

This keyword will have one of these effects, depending on whether
the caller uses check-error:

if check-error isn't used, it will be equivalent to an assert, and will crash
the program, unless the compiler flag --optimistic is given, in which case
nothing will happen.

If check-error is employed by the statement immediately after the statement
where the function was called, then the function finishes running, and
the check-error block will handle the error.  However, this will only work
if set-error sets the error to an integer other than 0.

in use, the check-error keyword looks like this:

func-call()
check-error error-val
    /* do something with error-val */

If the function in question is a part of a statement with many function
calls in it, then after the call where set-error is reached, any of the 
other calls in that statement are skipped.

Errors work under the hood by implementing two versions of each
function, one for when errors are checked, and another for when they
aren't.

The error-checked version of a function will take as its first argument
a pointer to an error integer.  The integer will be initialized to 0
before any calls, and will be checked after each call in the statement.
